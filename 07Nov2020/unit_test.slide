## Introduction

Goals of this talk:

- What, why & when
- Various unit testing workflows 
- Testing techniques
- Good practices
- Tips and tricks to use ginkgo effectively
- Handson exercise
- About gocenter

## What

A way of testing where the **smallest piece** of code of a software that can be logically isolated.
For example:  A function or a set of functions in a package

## Why

- Helps in verifying the small changes (refactoring, debugging) quickly.

.play small_change.go

## Why continue...

- Measure of quality of the code and gives confidence during frequent releases.
- Helps in understanding the complex logics.
- Helps in understanding the cause of failure quickly because black box testing is
helpful in only knowing what failed in order to know where it was failed or the cause
of failure is very tough.
- Great way to learn about a language as well as project.

Will discuss about **"When"** at the end of this talk.

## Testing workflows

There are various workflows that people follow, like: TBT, BDT.
- Both of the testing methodologies are adopted extensively in various projects.
- TBT is used for testing small units of a codebase whereas people prefer BDT for 
integration testing.
- We at jfrog use TBT for unit testing and BDT for functional testing.
- Kubernetes also uses same pattern.

## Table based testing (TBT)

- Map/slice is used to build inputs and expected outputs.
- Easy to implement and easy to extend further as we don't need to add boilerplate code again and again.
- Gives clear visualization of what's covered and what not.

## Table based testing (TBT) continue...

.code small_change_test.go /^func TestSmallChange/,/^}/

## Behaviour driven testing (BDT)

- Makes tests readable, just like plain engish.
- Requires lots of effort.
- Good in understanding the functionality of a project and explaining it to the stakeholders.
- Ginkgo framework is very famous and it makes testing fun.
- Learning curve is little high initially.

## Behaviour driven testing (BDT) continue...

Function to be tested

.code bdd/main.go /^func Sum/,/^}/

## Behaviour driven testing (BDT) continue...

.code bdd/main_test.go /^var _ = Describe/,/^}/

## Testing techniques

- Subtests and parallel tests
- Mocking
- Fuzzing


## Good practices

Go itself provides lots of testing tools as a part of its standard library and eases the job
of the developer, but there are some challenges while writing the units test for your business
logic. There are few keypoints which one should always keep in his mind while writing unit tests:

- Make everything configurable by inheriting them in struct (avoid global variables)
- Use interfaces if there are third party dependencies/system calls/database etc.
- Avoid mocking networkinig instead make helper functions to test the functionality. This gives us
ability to test lots of real world exceptions. 


## When

- If you think its easing your job of validating your changes/fixes.
- If you donot have enough integration test coverage, because setting up unit
test env is fairly easy as compared to writing integrations tests.
- If business logic depends on third party components, writing mocks is one time
effort but will be very much helpful in validating the changes (business logic) quickly.
